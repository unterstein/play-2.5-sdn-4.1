# Motivation

My good friend Seppel (@tuxBurner) is maintaining the SpringData-Neo4j-Plugin for the @playframework (https://github.com/tuxBurner/play-neo4jplugin).
On the other hand is Michael (@jexp) who visited us a several times in our java user group and we have a good relationship to him. He asked us how the plugin works with
the new SpringData in Version 4.x and honestly we had not that much time to upgrade and test it.
